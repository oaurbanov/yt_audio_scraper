# Scraper project

It is an audio dataSet generator. For training Neural Networks

Just put the youtube video links in the json array under "links" key, and $.wav$ file with each pronunced word will be extracted.

In order to extract each word the video should have automatic-generated subtitles.
For better extractions, the videos should have audio with low noise and silence (70 ms) between words. 


## Deps:

```
conda install --name audio_env -c conda-forge youtube-dl
```
